7. Rake tasks

  Rake tasks are custom build executable files that we are using to populate the postgresql database (Dwh) from our seeded data and submit data from web pages (quotes and contact us forms). Within theses task we establish a connection to our mysql DB and postgres DB, 
  
 

      (actual data to  connect is in the rake file not the read me)
This is an example of a rake task

  ``` Ruby
  desc "Import data from Quote Table to Fact Quote Table"
  task quotes: :environment do
    dwh = PG::Connection.new(host: 'localhost', port: port, dbname: "dbname", user: "user", password: "password")
    puts "lead table to fact_quote table"
    
    dwh.exec("TRUNCATE fact_quotes")

    dwh.prepare('to_fact_quotes', 'INSERT INTO fact_quotes (quote_id, creation, company_name, email, nb_elevator, created_at, updated_at) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)')
    Quote.all.each do |quotes|
      dwh.exec_prepared('to_fact_quotes', [quotes.id, quotes.created_at, quotes.quotes_company_name, quotes.quotes_email, quotes.elevator_amount])
    end
  end 
  ```

8. File attachement in the contact us form was also added and supports all types of files. the filename can be seen in the admin section of the leads table and in the database.

9. Charts were added in the admin panel through chartskick
10. updated routes week 5
